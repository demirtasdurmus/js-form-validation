# formValidationJavascript
A regex-dominated form validation project

Build a submission form using JS

1) Should have a name input that;
  * has min 6 chars,
  * has max 12 chars,
  * doesnt allow special chars
  * should have a feedback warning if doesn’t meet these requirements

2) Should have a gender input (might be radio buttons);
3) Should have a dropdown input in which the options are changed according to the gender above
4) Should have a date input which finally gives dd-mm-yyyy date format 
5) Should have a phone number input which has the exact   “0 555 555 55 55” format and have this format as you type(tip: use regex)

Note: You can console.log all the inputs after submission

example output:
*Adı-Soyadı: John Doe
*Cinsiyet: male
*Ürün: Pants
*Tarih: 12-03-2022
*Telefon:  0 555 555 55 55
